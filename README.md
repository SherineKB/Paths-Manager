# Paths-Manager

Developped for Eddy Studio : https://www.eddy.tv/

Paths Manager is a tool that allows you to easily manage and modify the file paths of images and videos used in a scene. It enables you to list these media files and edit their file paths to relocate them if needed (for example if they have been moved on your computer and you need to update their location.). Additionally, if a path is corrupted and the media is not used in the scene, you have the option to unlink them to avoid issues when sending files to the render farm.
